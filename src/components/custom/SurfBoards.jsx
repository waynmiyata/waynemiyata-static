                Wayne loved Samurai movies—the signature Wayne Miyata symbol is
                modeled after his favorite Japanese Samurai actor, Toshiro
                Mifune. The sturdy, classic construction of "Samurai" will
                perform for surfers of all skill levels.

                In Wayne's early 20's rumor had it that he would tape razor
                blades to the edge of his board, warding off other surfers from
                getting in the way of "his" waves. You'll own the water with a
                "Razor's Edge" — it's an aggressive tool for dominating waves of
                any size.

                Wayne mastered Kajukenbo Karate, the art of self-defense. From
                this training, he developed his own unique surfing style — a
                talent highly regarded throughout his life by other surfers,
                filmmakers, and photographers. "Black Belt" delivers a strong,
                graceful ride and helps you get creative with new moves.

                Wayne was dedicated to his Japanese heritage—the design on this
                board is one of his originals, modeled after Japan's Naval

                gives your surf an extra edge when you need it.

                favorite spots on the North Shore. "Banzai Ehukai" offers a
                thrilling ride no matter where you're surfing.
